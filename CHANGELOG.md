### Known Issues

- **ZIP duplicate basename silently overwrites (BUG-3).** Two ZIP entries sharing the same
  basename in different directories result in a silent last-one-wins overwrite rather than
  raising an error. See `REMAINING_ISSUES.md` BUG-3. *(resolved in subsequent patch)*
- **Redundant gate-override dead code in runner (DEAD-6).** `runner.py:_judge_case` contains
  a post-hoc gate-fail assignment that the model validator already enforces. See
  `REMAINING_ISSUES.md` DEAD-6. *(resolved in subsequent patch)*
- **`object.__setattr__` on non-frozen model (STYLE-1).** `CaseJudgment._gate_fail_forces_fail`
  uses `object.__setattr__` for a model that is not frozen. See `REMAINING_ISSUES.md`
  STYLE-1. *(resolved in subsequent patch)*
